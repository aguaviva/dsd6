# dsd6
Just a quick Android app for the dsd6 the bracelet.

It loads and displays the following data:

- heart beat
- steps
- "sports steps"

## permissions
Unlike the oficial app that requires access to all your personal details, this one doesnt require any special permissions other than that position, a thing that is required for the android ble stack to work.

# future work
This app does pretty much all I was after so unless I receive pull requests I wont be updating it much.

# the ugly
The app is linked to my band hw address, brace yourself, that happens to be hardcoded :) If you want to use it you need to put your own. Pull requests are welcome :)
